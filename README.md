Interesting how we can tell a story or reflect, as in this case, the significance of a service.
The information collected despite being the same (columns) for different periods of time, allows for different analyzes.
From my analysis in order to discover some growth phenomenon, I decided to take the same month in a different year.
From a single period, it can be observed how the gender of man consumes the service the most, despite the fact that the amount of null data may present us with some erroneous data, however, when counting with the following year, the same trend is maintained in terms of Regarding age, it is curious that there is some non-coherent information that reflects non-real ages, these data may reflect a missing validation either in the filling form, however these data are minimal, the majority of users being born between 1990- 2000.
We can also observe that people prefer the subscription than the consumer mode, it must also be taken into account that the large population of this city is floating because it is a tourist city, in fact in the maps it reflects subscriptions in non-tourist sites and yes of offices and homes.
Regarding the duration of the trips, it can be seen that the same average time has been maintained after a year, despite the fact that the number of trips made has increased.
As conclusions, the service is used constantly and grows over time, there are more and more subscribers, the time of consumption has not changed so it can be said that there is a captive market that remains.
The tool and the information allow you to do a lot with very little, of course it takes time for this, both to explore Tableau and for the data.
